BOston Neonatal Brain Injury Dataset for Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (BONBID-HIE)Â¶ Outcome Prediction and Lesion Segmentation Challenge

The 2nd Boston Neonatal Brain Injury Dataset for Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (BONBID-HIE) Challenge aims to advance AI-driven tools for neonatal brain injury assessment. Focused on Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), a critical condition in newborns, the challenge includes two tracks leveraging the BONBID dataset of brain imaging and clinical data.

Track 1: Lesion Segmentation
Participants develop models to accurately segment brain lesions in neonatal MRI scans. Performance will be assessed using metrics like Dice, MASD, and NSD. Accurate lesion segmentation is essential for understanding injury patterns and informing treatment decisions.

Track 2: Outcome Prediction
This track involves binary classification models predicting two-year outcomes for neonates based on imaging and clinical data. Metrics such as accuracy and F1 score will evaluate predictive models. Reliable outcome prediction can guide clinical decisions and improve care strategies.

The BONBID-HIE dataset includes skull-stripped ADC maps, Z_ADC maps, lesion labels, and long-term outcomes. Submissions are evaluated on a final test set, with top-ranking teams receiving recognition and opportunities to publish their work. The challenge seeks to enhance neonatal care by integrating AI for precise lesion analysis and robust outcome prediction.
